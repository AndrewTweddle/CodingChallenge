data/
    input/
        products.txt    - a JSON file of products
        listings.txt    - a JSON file of price listings (to be matched to products in products.txt)
    intermediate/       - will be generated by the investigation script, provided it is run from the 'python' sub-folder

                        - contains product records grouped by the classification pattern of the 'model' field,

    recordlinker/       - the Python module to perform the linking of products with listings

==================
Useful commands:

Run unit tests:         python -m recordlinker.test.classification_tests
                        python -m recordlinker.test.builder_tests
